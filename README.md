- -------------------Friend Finder------------------- -

This application offers users the ability to answer a short, twn question survey, and then match their results to those of another survey-taker whose results are closest to theirs. The idea behind the application is that individuals can complete the survey and get matched with someone with whom they will be compatible so that they can become friends :)
